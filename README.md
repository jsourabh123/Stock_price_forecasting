# Stock_Price_Forecasting
I have used pandas_datareader library to fetchclosing price of Apple share.we are considering data of six year from 1st jan 2014 to 1st jan 2020.I have split data into training_data(.65 of complete dataset) and testing_data. we have take time step as 100 i.e stock price of day 101 will be depends on last 100 days.Now,reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features] which is required for LSTM(long-short term memory).LSTM is variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.and we required the same thing here i.e predict stock closing price based on last 100 days closing price.We have used loss function as mean_squared_error and optimizer aas adam(adaptive moment gradient descent).we have used the model to predict closing price for future 30 days. and plot the output.
